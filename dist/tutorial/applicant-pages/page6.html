			<h3>Tips for the candidate</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><span>Be Honest:</span> The job must work for you. If you do not meet the requirements or the job doesnâ€™t meet yours, move on. Your time is too valuable to waste on a bad fit.</li>
				<li><span>Be Bold:</span> Take the time to really show off in steps two and three. This is your chance to impress your future manager, team, and colleagues, so take it seriously.</li>
				<li><span>Provide a good email address:</span> We use your email address to send important alerts about your progress as well as for employers to contact you once they unlock your information.</li>
				<li><span>Fill out your profile:</span> Include all the information, attachments, and links you want the employers to see once they unlock your information.</li>
